## Description 
This project aims to create an engaging digital platform catering specifically to younger audiences between the ages of 7 and 14. The website serves as an information hub, offering details about the museum itself, as well as an interactive blog section. The blog provides visitors with the opportunity to explore exhibition content ahead of their visit, enhancing their overall experience. We invite you to join us on this exciting project, where we strive to create an immersive and educational online space for our young visitors.
